# Notes
- ## Waking Up
	- When you get up (within 30 minutes), turn on the lights (as many overhead lights as possible) and get bright light first for several minutes, without sunglasses, in your eyes. You'll know if the light is too bright because you'll want to close your eye lids so don't damage your eyes. It should come from sunlight (or a light pad), even on cloudy days, as phone screens etc are not bright enough. [^1]
		- This will help start healthy Cortisol and start the clock on Melatonin to naturally help you get more tired later in the day and ready for sleep. You'll also get a Dopamine release and this will elevate your mood.
			- Data suggests that getting this Cortisol pulse earlier in the day helps with mood as well, if it ends up later in the day then it is shown to be associated with depression.
			- Blue light blocking during the day can mess your timing of Cortisol and Melatonin, thus messing with your Circadian clock, so be careful with this.
			- 14 - 16 Hours prior to when you want to sleep is the ideal time to get the morning light exposure.
	- ## Four Things that Time our Circadian Biology
		- These create wake-up signals and your body will start to anticipate them.
			- Light; the most powerful stimulus for your Biological clock.
			- Exercise; gives more signals to the body as to when you should be active.
			- Feeding; If you eat earlier in the day this can help as well and other studies suggest that breakfast should be your biggest meal of the day.
			- Social Cues; Interacting with other people or even your dog early in the day.
- ## Getting Ready for Sleep
	- As you approach the evening and want to start getting ready for sleep, it's time to start avoiding bright lights of any color (not just blue lights).
	- If possible, place whatever lights are around lower in your visual field. You can wear blue blocks later in the evening if you want. 
- The more you do these things, the more the body and mind adjusts and learns. Doing these practices is like properly winding up a watch or clock for best use.
- Physiological sigh [^2] - We do this activity in our sleep, you can observe it in other people and animals as well. When children or people cry, you'll see people do it too. It is something the relaxes us by off-loading a lot of carbon dioxide at one time and can be used in a stressful moment to bring down your stress more immediately.

## Footnotes
[^1]: You could do a 10k lux bright lamp with a smart plug, set it turns on around the time you want. This can help you wake up and give you the light exposure you need to elevate your mood and set your Circadian clock. 
[^2]: Technique of breathing, it is two inhales and one longer exhale. Remember, per [[Breath]] breathing is best when done through your nose.
