## Summary
In Courage Is Calling, Ryan Holiday breaks down the elements of fear, an expression of cowardice, the elements of courage, an expression of bravery, and lastly, the elements of heroism, an expression of valor. Through engaging stories about historic and contemporary leaders, including Charles De Gaulle, Florence Nightingale, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Holiday shows you how to conquer fear and practice courage in your daily life.  
  
You'll also delve deep into the moral dilemmas and courageous acts of lesser-known, but equally as important, figures from ancient and modern history, such as Helvidius Priscus, a Roman Senator who stood his ground against emperor Vespasian, even in the face of death; Frank Serpico, a former New York City Police Department Detective who exposed police corruption; and Frederick Douglass and a slave named Nelly, whose fierce resistance against her captors inspired his own crusade to end slavery.

## `ris:Book3` Book Highlights
- Pg. 15
	- If you look down instead of forward then it is easy to be scared. Fear will not help you more forward. 
	- The couple that only see's how hard having a family will be will never start the family, due to fear.
- Pg. 20
	- At the root of most fear is what other people think of us. It paralyzes us and distorts our world view. 
	- We're afraid of what people will say about us, even if we're not going to be around to hear it.
- Pg. 21
	- People would rather be complicit in a crime than speak up. People would rather die in a pandemic than be the only one in a mask.
	- They'd rather go along with something that will tarnish their legacy than raise their voice ever so slightly and risk standing alone or apart for ten minutes. 
- Pg. 27
	- Fear setting [^1] 
	- Premeditatio Malorum [^2]
	- It is the unexpected blows that land most heavily and painfully. By expecting, defining, wrestling with what can happen, we are making it less scary and less dangerous at the same time. 
	- We need to cultivate the courage to think about all the things that could happen, the things that are unpleasant to think about, the unusual, the unexpected, the unlikely. It's not just a matter of reducing our anxiety about exaggerated uncertainties, it's also about finding certainty in the unknowns. 
- Pg. 31
	- Don't waste time worrying about whether things are going to be hard, because they will be. Instead, focus on the fact that these things will help you. This is why you needn't fear them. Our bruises and scars become armor. Our struggles become experience and they make us better.
	- Remember that not everyone would have the strength to experience the hardships of life and come out of them unharmed. **Do you have that strength?**
	- It's good that it's hard. It deters the cowards and intrigues the courageous.
- Pg. 37
	- All the energy we spend fearing that we'll make it worse is energy not spent making it better.
	- The battle against fear is a full-time job. None of us have it handled so well that we can afford to spend much time monitoring how others are doing with theirs - then or now. The best we can try to do is learn from our peers, past, and present, and apply their lessons to our own life. 
- Pg. 40
	- Don't bother with "What would I do in their shoes", ask: 
		- What am I doing now?
		- How are you handling your own life, your own fears?
	- Until we know someone's reasons, we don't even know that they acted wrongly. 
	- Waste not a second questioning another man's courage. Put that scrutiny solely on your own.
- Pg. 51
	- We must be strong enough to ask:
		- **"What if everyone acted this way?", "What if everyone put their own interests about everything else?", "What if everyone was afraid?"**
			- Is that the world you want to live in?
- Pg. 54
	- All growth is a leap in the dark. It you're afraid of that, you'll never do anything worthwhile. If you take counsel of your fears, you'll never take that step, make that leap. 
	- If fear is to be a driving force in your life, fear what you'll miss. Fear what happens if you don't act. Fear what you'll think of you down the road, for having dared so little. Think of what you're leaving on the table. Think of the terrifying costs of playing small.
- Pg. 65
	- Our fears point us, like a self-indicting arrow, int he direction of the right thing to do.
- Pg. 119
	- Some of us are afraid to be different. Most everyone is afraid of being difficult. But there is freedom in those traits. Freedom to fight, aggressively, repeatedly, for what we believe in. To insist on a higher standard. To not compromise. To not accept that the "matter has been settled."
- Pg. 129
	- No one is more miserable than the person who has made cop-outs and cowardice their go-to decision. 
- Pg. 138
	- **Courage, like fear, is contagious**
	- You make a difference when you're brave because you make others brave in the process. Like a virus, calm spreads by contact. 
	- Are you part of the problem or part of the solution?
- Pg. 143
	- If you're going to speak out, then sign your name to it. Sign your name to everything that you do - that's the basic thing to do. This is the source from which self-respect springs and leaders are made. 
- Pg. 206
	- There is zero glory in winning a battle - whether physical or verbal - to further immortal aims. And nothing is more immortal than unnecessary conflict. 
- Pg. 210
	- Galileo spent the remainder of his life under house arrest after daring to assert that the Earth revolves around the Sun and for refusing to retract this claim. That's what owning something looks like. 
- Pg. 232
	- Leaders risk themselves for us. They step to the front. They make their courage contagious.
